- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joseph Eppinger
- ðŸ’¼ I am a Lead Software Engineer at Mastercard. 
  I work primarily in network policy automation using golang and terraform, but I use a bunch of other stuff like Ruby, Python, C... the list goes on forever!
  I can't say much more about that here, but I have a particular interest in making minecraft mods, which is primarily what you'll see here!
  
- ðŸ“« I used to provide my email here, but with the rise of spam in my inbox, I've omitted it. Sorry if that's an inconvenience!

<!---
- ðŸ’¼ I used to be a System Programmer at Northern Arizona University in the Collaborative Computing Lab. 
  I work primarily on full stack web technologies in Django and Ruby on Rails.
  I also frequently work on system level maintenance and tasks on Ubuntu installations located on AWS's EC2 platform.
  This lends to writing a lot of system level scripts meant to scrape data, process data, and maintain backups.
