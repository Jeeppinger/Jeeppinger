- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joseph Eppinger
- ðŸ’¼ I am a System Programmer at Northern Arizona University in the Collaborative Computing Lab. 
  I work primarily on full stack web technologies in Django and Ruby on Rails.
  I also frequently work on system level maintenance and tasks on Ubuntu installations located on AWS's EC2 platform.
  This lends to writing a lot of system level scripts meant to scrape data, process data, and maintain backups.
